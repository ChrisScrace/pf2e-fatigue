# pf2e-fatigue
A small Foundry VTT module to apply the fatigued condition to characters automatically.

## How it works:

Just hit rest to start the timer:

Then advance the time 16 hours:

Hey presto, you're fatigued:

## Wait, there's more!

* If the character has the feat Forge Day's Rest they will be asked when resting if the rest was for 12 or more hours and this will be taken into account when applying fatigued
* Also sets fatigued and outputs a message to chat when resting while wearing armor (can be toggled off in settings, on by default)

N.B. 
* Timer starts on rest so your players should hit rest once the clock has been advanced and their rest is completed.
* GM must be online in order for Fatigued condition to be applied after timer expires
