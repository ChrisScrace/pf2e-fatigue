# pf2e-fatigue
A small Foundry VTT module to apply the fatigued condition to characters automatically.

## How it works:

Just hit rest to start the timer:

Then advance the time 16 hours:

Hey presto, you're fatigued:

Length of time before player becomes fatigued can be set in the module settings:

Timer starts on rest so your players should hit rest once the clock has been advanced and their rest is completed.
